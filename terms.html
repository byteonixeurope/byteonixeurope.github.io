  <h1>Clickable Media: Terms of Use</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Thank you for using Clickable Media (collectively, the Service) and the services, tools, and assets we make available to you for support you in creating content on social media platforms.</p>

  <h2>Our Service</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided by Byteonix Europe and allows paying creators to use the "Clickable Filming Studio", which provides tools like special props, maps, and other features to help create better content and provide more engagement on social media platforms.</p>

  <h2>Applicable Terms</h2>
  <p>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, and other policies which are listed in these terms (together, the "Agreement").</p>
  <p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>Who may use the Service?</h2>
  <h3 class="sub-heading">Age Requirement</h3>
  <p>You must be at least 13 to use the Clickable Filming Studio, or have permission from a legal guardian or parent.</p>

  <h3 class="sub-heading">Country Restrictions</h3>
  <p>Our services are available to everyone globally. However, some features due to their nature, may not be available in South Korea, Belgium, Netherlands and Turkey.</p>

  <h2>License Policy</h2>
  <p>To use the Service, you need to purchase a license. These can be bought for 25 GBP each or you can reach out to administrator of the Service to purchase one in another form of payment. Clickable Media can revoke your license at any time for any reason with no refund.</p>
  <p>When you purchase a license, you can add up to 5 alternative accounts or people to help you create your content. However, if you add different people to your license, they are not allowed to create their own content under your license. Everyone must use their own license to create content. We have systems in place that prevent this. If you are found to be allowing other users to use your license to create content, then your license may be revoked.</p>
  <p>Using the Service without a license is illegal, and against the Terms of Use. If we find your content is using the Service without a license or our explicit permission, then we will remove your content under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>

  <p><strong>Effective as of December 21, 2020</strong></p>
